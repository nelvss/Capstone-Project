# Supabase Database Integration - Complete Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the complete integration of your booking management system with Supabase database. All hardcoded data has been replaced with live database operations.

## ✅ Completed Integration

### 1. Backend API Endpoints (server.js)

**Booking Management:**
- `POST /api/bookings` - Create main booking record
- `GET /api/bookings` - Fetch all bookings (with filtering)
- `GET /api/bookings/:id` - Fetch single booking details
- `PUT /api/bookings/:id/status` - Update booking status
- `DELETE /api/bookings/:id` - Delete booking

**Specialized Bookings:**
- `POST /api/booking-tour` - Save tour bookings
- `POST /api/booking-vehicles` - Save vehicle rentals
- `POST /api/booking-diving` - Save diving bookings
- `POST /api/booking-van-rental` - Save van rental bookings
- `POST /api/package-booking` - Save package bookings

**Lookup Data:**
- `GET /api/hotels` - Fetch available hotels
- `GET /api/vehicles` - Fetch available vehicles
- `GET /api/van-destinations` - Fetch van rental destinations
- `GET /api/package-pricing` - Fetch package pricing data
- `GET /api/tour-pricing` - Fetch tour pricing data

**Analytics:**
- `GET /api/analytics/revenue` - Get revenue data by date range
- `GET /api/analytics/bookings-count` - Get booking counts
- `GET /api/analytics/popular-services` - Get most booked services

**Payments:**
- `POST /api/payments` - Record payment
- `GET /api/payments` - Fetch payment history
- `GET /api/payments/booking/:id` - Get payments for specific booking

### 2. Frontend Forms Integration

**Package Booking Form (package_summary.js):**
- ✅ Connected to `/api/bookings` for main booking creation
- ✅ Connected to `/api/package-booking` for package details
- ✅ Real-time submission with loading states
- ✅ Error handling and user feedback

**Tour Booking Form (tour_summary.js):**
- ✅ Connected to `/api/bookings` for main booking creation
- ✅ Multi-table support for tours, vehicles, diving, van rentals
- ✅ Parallel submission to multiple specialized endpoints
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling

### 3. Dashboard Integration

**Owner Dashboard (dashboard.js):**
- ✅ Replaced hardcoded bookings array with API calls
- ✅ Real-time data loading from `/api/bookings`
- ✅ Status updates connected to `/api/bookings/:id/status`
- ✅ Email notifications integrated with status changes
- ✅ Error handling and fallback states

**Staff Dashboard (staff_dashboard.js):**
- ✅ Same functionality as owner dashboard
- ✅ API-connected booking management
- ✅ Real-time status updates
- ✅ Email integration

**Analytics Dashboard (analytics.js):**
- ✅ Connected to analytics API endpoints
- ✅ Real revenue and booking data
- ✅ Dynamic chart updates
- ✅ Fallback to sample data if API fails

### 4. Environment Configuration

**Environment Variables (.env):**
```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://vjeykmpzwxqonkfnzbjw.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
PORT=3000
```

| Hotels | `hotels` | `/api/hotels` |
| Vehicles | `vehicles` | `/api/vehicles` |
| Destinations | `van_destinations` | `/api/van-destinations` |
| Package Pricing | `package_pricing` | `/api/package-pricing` |
| Tour Pricing | `tour_only` | `/api/tour-pricing` |
| Payments | `payments` | `/api/payments` |
| Users | `users` | ✅ Already connected |
| Feedback | `feedback` | ✅ Already connected |

## How to Test the Integration

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
cd my-express-web
npm start
```

### 2. Run Integration Tests
```bash
cd my-express-web
node test-integration.js
```

### 3. Test Booking Flow
1. Go to `user/form/booking_form.html`
2. Fill out the form and proceed through the booking process
3. Check the Supabase dashboard to see the data being saved
4. Check the owner/staff dashboards to see the new booking appear

### 4. Test Dashboard Operations
1. Go to `owner/dashboard.html` or `staff/staff_dashboard.html`
2. Verify bookings are loaded from the database
3. Test confirm/cancel/reschedule actions
4. Check that status updates are saved to the database

## Key Features Implemented

### Real-time Data Synchronization
- All dashboards now show live data from Supabase
- Status changes are immediately reflected in the database
- Email notifications are sent when status changes

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling for all API calls
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback states when API is unavailable

### Loading States
- Loading indicators during API calls
- Disabled buttons during operations

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Email Settings**: Update the `.env` file with your actual email credentials
2. **Test All Flows**: Run through each booking type to ensure data is saved correctly
3. **Monitor Performance**: Check that the API responses are fast enough for your users
4. **Add More Validation**: Consider adding more business logic validation
5. **Implement Caching**: For better performance, consider adding caching for lookup data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Failed to load bookings" error**
   - Check if the server is running on port 3000
   - Verify Supabase credentials in `.env` file
   - Check network connectivity

2. **"Table not accessible" error**
   - Verify table names match exactly in Supabase
   - Check RLS (Row Level Security) policies
   - Ensure the anon key has proper permissions

3. **Email sending fails**
   - Update EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASSWORD in `.env`
   - Use app-specific passwords for Gmail
   - Check if 2FA is enabled on your email account

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Check the server console for API errors
3. Run the integration test script to verify connectivity
4. Verify your Supabase project settings and table structure
