# 📧 Email Notification System - Complete Setup

## ✅ What Has Been Set Up

I've successfully implemented a complete email notification system for your booking dashboard with the following features:

### 🎯 Features Implemented

1. **Email Server (Node.js + Express)**
   - Location: `my-express-web/server.js`
   - Handles email sending via Nodemailer
   - Professional HTML email templates
   - Error handling and logging

2. **Frontend Integration**
   - Updated: `owner/dashboard.js`
   - Added click handlers for all three buttons
   - Loading states and confirmations
   - Success/error notifications

3. **Three Email Types**:
   - ✅ **Confirm** - Green-themed confirmation email
   - ❌ **Cancel** - Red-themed cancellation notice
   - 📅 **Reschedule** - Blue-themed reschedule request

### 📁 Files Created/Modified

**New Files:**
- ✅ `my-express-web/server.js` - Email server with API
- ✅ `my-express-web/.env.example` - Configuration template
- ✅ `my-express-web/.env` - Your configuration (needs credentials)
- ✅ `my-express-web/.gitignore` - Protects sensitive files
- ✅ `my-express-web/start-server.ps1` - Quick start script
- ✅ `EMAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Detailed documentation

**Modified Files:**
- ✅ `my-express-web/package.json` - Added dependencies
- ✅ `owner/dashboard.js` - Added email functionality

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Configure Email
Edit `my-express-web/.env` file:
```
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
PORT=3000
```

**For Gmail App Password:**
1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Enable 2-Step Verification
3. Click "App passwords" → Select Mail → Other
4. Copy the 16-character password
5. Paste in .env file

### Step 2: Start the Server
Open PowerShell in `my-express-web` folder:
```powershell
npm start
```
Or use the quick start script:
```powershell
.\start-server.ps1
```

### Step 3: Use the Dashboard
1. Open `owner/dashboard.html` in your browser
2. Click any action button (Confirm/Cancel/Reschedule)
3. Confirm the action
4. Email will be sent automatically! ✉️

## 🎨 Email Templates Preview

### Confirm Email ✅
- **Subject:** "✅ Booking Confirmed - Your Reservation Details"
- **Theme:** Green with success styling
- **Contains:** Full booking details, arrival/departure dates, pricing
- **Message:** Welcoming confirmation message

### Cancel Email ❌
- **Subject:** "❌ Booking Cancelled - Confirmation"
- **Theme:** Red with cancellation styling
- **Contains:** Cancelled booking details, refund information
- **Message:** Cancellation notice with 5-7 day refund timeline

### Reschedule Email 📅
- **Subject:** "📅 Booking Reschedule Request Received"
- **Theme:** Blue with informational styling
- **Contains:** Current booking details, next steps
- **Message:** Acknowledgment with 24-hour response promise

## 🔧 How It Works

### Frontend Flow:
```
User clicks button → Confirmation dialog → Loading state → 
API call to server → Email sent → Success message → Button updated
```

### Backend Flow:
```
Receive API request → Validate data → Select email template → 
Send via Nodemailer → Return success/error → Log result
```

## 📊 Button Behavior

| Button | Initial State | Loading State | Success State |
|--------|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| Confirm | "Confirm" (Green) | "Sending..." (Disabled) | "✓ Confirmed" (Darker Green) |
| Cancel | "Cancel" (Red) | "Sending..." (Disabled) | "✓ Cancelled" (Darker Red) |
| Reschedule | "Reschedule" (Blue) | "Sending..." (Disabled) | "✓ Rescheduled" (Darker Blue) |

## 🔐 Security Features

- ✅ Environment variables for credentials
- ✅ .gitignore to prevent credential leaks
- ✅ CORS protection
- ✅ Input validation on server
- ✅ App passwords instead of main password

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Server won't start
**Solution:** 
- Verify you're in the correct directory
- Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are installed
- Check if port 3000 is available

### Problem: Emails not sending
**Solution:**
- Check `.env` file has correct credentials
- For Gmail: Verify App Password is correct (16 chars, no spaces)
- Enable 2-Step Verification on Google Account
- Check server console for specific error messages

### Problem: "Failed to connect to email server"
**Solution:**
- Ensure server is running (`npm start`)
- Verify `API_URL` in dashboard.js is `http://localhost:3000`
- Check browser console (F12) for network errors

### Problem: Button doesn't respond
**Solution:**
- Open browser console (F12) to check for JavaScript errors
- Ensure server is running
- Check network tab for failed API requests
- Clear browser cache and reload

   - Check the recipient's email inbox

4. **Verify email delivery:**
